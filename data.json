Firefox protects you by preventing navigation to such sites if there is a problem in securely establishing a connection. Contact the owners of the website and ask them to update their TLS version to a version that is still current and still secure.  Other websites may require HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) and will not allow access with an insecure connection. "}
